# Password-Generator

This simple program generates a password and save it in the archive called password.txt at the same directory that is your Password Generator.exe.

You can download it from this link of my Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rlmiasonvpcdqua/Password%20Generator.exe?dl=0

Password Generator has a simple interface. All you do in this program, it is by your keyboard like in the terminal.

Explaning how it works:

There are few types of password that you can choose to generate yours. Moreover, I really recommend you choose more than twelve characters for your password to be shure of that the password generated is really strong.
L   => Only letters
N   => Only numbers
C   => Only special characters
LN  => Letters and numbers
LC  => Letters and special characters
NC  => Numbers and special characters
LNC => Letters, numbers and special characters

After that, you can name your password and this name will be at the .txt file to separate password of others.

What I use to create this program:
How I was leaning python and using it at my college, I choose it to create this program. Besides that, to create an executable of the python file I used the PyInstaller is a normal Python package.

Also, I put a custom icon in the .exe file. I took it from the site flaticon: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/password" title="password icons">Password icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
